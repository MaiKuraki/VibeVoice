The primary obstacles are now in our halls of government, in our financial institutions, and, uh, in our collective willingness to face this reality and act at the scale it requires."

There’s no time for anything else."

That temporary breach of 1.5 degrees served as a final, unambiguous warning. The scientific challenge now is to monitor these accelerating changes.

I want to pivot from the problems we've detailed so thoroughly to the specific pathways forward that are emerging. Beyond the high-level policy failures, where are the new fronts in this challenge?"
